MEK4250 â€“ Finite Element Methods in Computational Mechanics

## Course content
The course deals with the solution of partial differential equations in computational mechanics like heat conduction, viscous flow, porous flow and elastic deformations. The focus is on finite element methods and stability analysis is central. Subjects include efficient methods, error control, mixed methods, splitting schemes and implementation in FEniCS.
